<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- A doctype tells the browser what version of HTML the page is written in -->
<!-- If you forget to include this line of code in your file, 
  then some of the HTML 5 tags like <article>, < footer >, and <header>  
  may not be supported by the browser. -->
<html lang="en">
<!-- The <html> tag is the top level element of the HTML file. 
  You will nest the <head> and <body> tags inside of it. -->
<!-- The lang attribute inside the opening <html> tag sets the language for the page. 
  It is also good to include it for accessibility reasons, because screen readers will 
  know how to properly pronounce the text. -->

<head>
    <!-- The <head> tags contain information that is processed by machines. 
  Inside the <head> tags, you will nest metadata which is data that describes 
  the document to the machine. -->
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <!-- UTF-8 is the standard character encoding you should use in your web pages. 
      This will usually be the first <meta> tag shown in the <head> element -->
    <link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <!-- This tag renders the width of the page to the width of the device's screen size. 
      If you have a mobile device that is 600px wide, then the browser window will 
      also be 600px wide. -->
    <!-- The initial-scale controls the zoom level. The value of 1 for the initial-scale 
      prevents the default zoom by browsers -->
    <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
    <meta name="description" content="Web site created using create-react-app" />
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/logo192.png" />
    <!--
      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
      user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/
    -->
    <link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />
    <!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      This HTML file is a template.
      If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.

      You can add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to this file.
      The build step will place the bundled scripts into the <body> tag.

      To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
      To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
